# Sonic-Paradox-Video-for-Windows-Player
A video player designed for Windows 95 utilising WinAPI and SDL 1.2.

To build you will need:
  - GCC (I used `MinGW.org GCC-6.3.0-1` because it works with Win95)
  - SDL 1.2.15

After installing all dependencies, modify the `SP_BUILD.BAT` with your SDL 1.2 location (unless you have it in PATH) and run.
